# Computational Intelligence for Optimization 24/25 - NOVA IMS

Welcome to the repository for the **Computational Intelligence for Optimization** course at NOVA IMS. This repository contains all the materials and resources related to the course, including weekly Jupyter notebooks and the optimization library that will be built throughout the semester.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- /notebooks-class: This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used in class each week
- /notebooks-solution: This folder contains the same Jupyter notebooks used in class but with the cells filled with the solutions. YOU SHOULD NOT EDIT THESE NOTEBOOKS, and instead edit the ones in `notebooks-class`
- /library: The source code for the optimization library we will build throughout the semester. This includes:
   - /algorithms: Functions and classes that implement a variety of optimization algorithms
   - /problems: Classes that define and implement various optimization problems and provide a way to solve them using the algorithms developed

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Make sure you have git installed**: Run `git --version` on a command shell. If `git` is not recognized, you need to install it. You can find the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inesmcm26/CIFO-24-25.git
```

2. **Install a code editor (VSCode recommended)**: Download a code editor that has support for Jupyer notebooks. If you choose to use VSCode, install the `Jupyter` extension

3. **Setup**: Go to `/notebooks/P1-Setup-and-OOP.ipynb` and follow the setup steps.

4. **Update the Repository on Your Machine**: To fetch the latest updates from the repository, open a command prompt in the project folder and run `git pull`. You must do this in the beginning of each class or whenever your local copy is out of date.
