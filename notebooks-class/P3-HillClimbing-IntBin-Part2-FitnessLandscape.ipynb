In contrast, when we define the neighborhood as the integers obtained by flipping a single bit in the binary representation (Option 2), we consistently reach the global optimum.\n",

    "A **fitness landscape  is a visual intuition of the difficulty of the algorithm in solving the problem**. It represents how solutions relate to their fitness and how they relate to each other via the **neighborhood**. Each solution is a point in the landscape, with its **height** indicating how good it is.\n",

    "If we define the neighborhood using Option 1 we only have 2 neighbors, each with a certain fitness value. Some solutions have neighbors with better fitness, while others don't, leading to local optima. As a result, the fitness landscape is rugged, with multiple local optima that can trap optimization algorithms.\n",

    "On the other hand, if we define it using Option 2, we have 4 neighbors, each with a certain fitness value. For every solution, there is at least one neighbor with better fitness.
